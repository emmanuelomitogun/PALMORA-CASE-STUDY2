## **1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This report analyzes Palmora Group’s internal compensation structure and performance evaluation system with a special lens on gender equity. Triggered by a social media campaign alleging gender bias (#PalmoraTheManufacturingPatriarchy), the company faced growing public pressure. As an external consultant, I was engaged to investigate the real facts.

The findings were clear: some departments showed equity success, but others revealed troubling disparities in pay, performance ratings, and bonus distribution. A structured roadmap with data-backed recommendations is now presented to restore trust and fairness in Palmora’s organizational framework.

---

## **2. OBJECTIVES**

* To audit gender distribution across departments and regions
* To evaluate salary and bonus allocations by gender
* To assess compliance with regulatory wage requirements
* To identify gaps in performance rating practices
* To provide a data-driven roadmap to improve internal equity

---

## **3. PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Palmora was publicly accused of fostering gender inequity in pay and promotions. Internally, leadership lacked clarity on the validity of these claims. The issue wasn’t just reputational – it risked talent loss, regulatory scrutiny, and poor employee morale.

---

## **4. METHODOLOGY**

1. **Data Collection**: Extracted 946 employee records from Palmora’s HRIS
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handled NULL values, filtered departed staff, and flagged 40 undisclosed gender entries
3. **Segmentation**: By region, department, and gender
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Salary vs Bonus vs Performance ratings
5. **Equity Check**: Salary band vs gender and region
6. **Compliance Assessment**: Benchmarked against ₦90,000 manufacturing wage standard

---

## **5. DATA CLEANING**

* Total records: **946**
* Undisclosed gender: **4.23% (40 staff)**
* Departed employees removed for consistency
* 6 departments with NULL labels corrected

Findings from missing ratings (8%) and undisclosed gender helped shape the recommendation to improve psychological safety and data integrity.

## **6. PROJECT OVERVIEW**

Client: Palmora Group (Manufacturing Company - Nigeria)
Role: HR Analytics Expert (Consultant)
Duration: 3 weeks
Reporting to: Mr. Yunus Shofoluwe (CHRO) & Mr. Ayodeji Chukwuma (CEO)
Tools Used: Excel, Power BI, Python, Statistical Analysis, Data Visualization

The Challenge That Started It All: Picture this: You're running a successful manufacturing company, and suddenly you're trending on social media with the hashtag **"Palmora, the Manufacturing Patriarchy."** That's exactly what happened to Palmora Group. The media storm wasn't just about reputation—it was threatening real business expansion plans. The leadership team knew they needed more than damage control; they needed the truth, backed by data.

**What I Delivered**: A comprehensive gender equity analysis that revealed over **₦2.9M** in compensation gaps and created a bonus allocation framework that gave leadership the strategic insights they needed to make informed decisions about scaling their business while addressing legitimate concerns about workplace equity.

---

## **7. INSIGHTS**

When I first walked into Palmora's headquarters, I could feel the tension. The executive team was caught between external pressure and internal uncertainty. They genuinely wanted to do right by their employees, but they also needed to know: Were the allegations true? If so, how deep did the problem go? And most importantly, what would it take to fix it?

This wasn't just another HR project—it was about helping a company understand itself better while navigating a potential crisis that could impact hundreds of jobs and millions in revenue.

---

 **MY ANALYTICAL APPROACH**

How I Tackled the Challenge: When dealing with sensitive topics like gender equity, I've learned that the data needs to be bulletproof. So I started with a comprehensive audit of 946 employee records across three regional offices. But here's the thing—raw data doesn't tell the whole story. I needed to understand not just what was happening, but why it was happening.

**The Data Journey:**

* HRIS employee database: 946 records across Lagos, Abuja, and Kaduna
* Compensation structures: Every salary, bonus, and benefit tracked
* Performance evaluations: Looking for patterns in how people were rated
* Departmental breakdowns: Understanding where problems might be hiding
* Regional workforce distribution: Seeing if geography played a role

**The Reality of Data Cleaning:** Here's something they don't teach you in textbooks—real HR data is messy. I found 4% of employees who hadn't disclosed their gender, employees with no salary data (they'd left the company), and departments marked as "NULL." Each of these anomalies told a story. The gender non-disclosure rate, for instance, was higher than typical, suggesting employees might not feel safe sharing personal information—a red flag worth investigating.

---

 **WHAT THE DATA REVEALED**

**The Numbers That Mattered Most**

**Gender Distribution:**

* Male employees: 49.15% (465 staff)
* Female employees: 46.62% (441 staff)
* Undisclosed gender: 4.23% (40 staff)

At first glance, this looked reasonably balanced. But that 4% non-disclosure rate caught my attention. In my experience, when employees don't feel comfortable sharing basic demographic information, it often signals deeper trust issues within the organization.

**Regional Patterns That Raised Questions:** The most striking finding came from Kaduna, where male employees collectively earned ₦13.6M compared to ₦11.9M for female employees. This wasn't just a number on a spreadsheet—it represented real people with real financial lives. I needed to understand whether this reflected role distribution, historical hiring patterns, or something more concerning.

---

**THE COMPENSATION REALITY CHECK**

**Where the Problems Were Hiding**

**Departments with Significant Disparities:**

* Legal Department: Male staff out-earned female staff by ₦1.2M aggregate
* Product Management: 19% compensation gap (₦3.57M male vs. ₦2.9M female)
* Support Division: ₦730,000 differential despite comparable headcount

**But Here's What Gave Me Hope:**

* Engineering: Female compensation actually exceeded male by ₦400,000+
* Services: Near-perfect parity (₦3.06M female vs. ₦2.93M male)

This was the breakthrough moment. The fact that some departments had achieved equity proved that fair compensation wasn't just possible at Palmora—it was already happening. The question wasn't whether they could fix the problem, but why some departments had figured it out while others hadn't.

---

**THE REGULATORY WAKE-UP CALL**

**Meeting the ₦90,000 Minimum Wage Requirement**

When I ran the numbers against the new manufacturing minimum wage requirement, the results were sobering:

* Compliant employees: 804 (85%)
* Non-compliant employees: 142 (15%)
* Required investment: ₦3.55M annually

The departments requiring immediate attention were Support, Training, and Marketing. This wasn't just about compliance—it was about ensuring every employee could maintain a decent standard of living.

**Regional Salary Band Analysis**

* **Lagos Region (Commercial Capital):** What surprised me was that Lagos, despite being Nigeria's commercial hub, had the highest concentration of lower-band employees. This suggested either market positioning issues or internal salary compression that needed addressing.
* **Abuja Region (Government Hub):** The most balanced distribution, likely reflecting the region's stable economic environment and competitive government contractor market.
* **Kaduna Region (Industrial Center):** Solid middle-band concentration, but the gender disparities here were the most pronounced.

Absolutely. Continuing directly from Section 12 — keeping everything **exactly as you originally wrote it**:

 **THE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION PUZZLE**

**Bonus Distribution Insights**
The performance-based bonus system told an interesting story:

* Total distributed: ₦11.6 million
* Recipients: 874 employees (92%)
* No bonus: 72 employees (8%)

**The troubling finding:** 8% of employees received no bonus, not due to poor performance—but because they had no performance rating recorded at all. This isn't just a data oversight; it signals inconsistency in how managers are evaluating staff. When performance tracking isn't enforced uniformly, it results in real financial exclusion—and can harm morale, trust, and retention over time.

**Regional Bonus Patterns:**

* Lagos: ₦1.2M (Average: ₦8,000 per recipient)
* Abuja: ₦1.8M (Average: ₦12,000 per recipient)
* Kaduna: ₦1.6M (Average: ₦10,667 per recipient)

**The Gender Gap in Bonuses:**

* Male employees: Average bonus ₦12,500
* Female employees: Average bonus ₦10,800
* Gap: ₦1,700 average difference

But here's the crucial insight: This gap correlated directly with performance rating disparities, suggesting the issue wasn't necessarily in the bonus calculation system itself, but in how performance evaluations were being conducted.

## **13. MY STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Phase 1: Stop the Bleeding (0–3 months)**

**Why these actions first:** You can't fix systemic issues until you address the immediate problems that are actively harming employees and the company's reputation.

1. **Mandatory performance evaluation protocols:** That 8% non-participation rate in performance reviews isn't just unfair—it's creating legal liability and directly impacting people's livelihoods
2. **Focused compensation audits:** Target the departments where disparities are most pronounced
3. **Manager training programs:** Bias in performance evaluation is often unconscious, but it's still harmful

### **Phase 2: Build the Foundation (3–12 months)**

**The reasoning:** Once you've addressed immediate issues, you can focus on creating sustainable systems.

1. **Standardization frameworks:** Use Engineering and Services as model departments—they've already proven it can be done
2. **Regional compensation review:** Especially in Lagos, where market positioning seems misaligned
3. **Anonymous feedback systems:** Address that concerning 4% gender disclosure reluctance

### **Phase 3: Create Lasting Change (12+ months)**

**Long-term thinking:** This phase is about ensuring these problems never resurface.

1. **Annual gender equity auditing:** External validation prevents internal blind spots
2. **Mentorship and development programs:** Address performance rating disparities at their source
3. **Cultural competency training:** Particularly important for addressing regional variations

---

## **14. THE BUSINESS CASE FOR CHANGE**

**Why This Matters Beyond “Doing the Right Thing”**

**The Cost of Inaction:**

* Estimated annual turnover costs: ₦5.2M from equity-related departures
* Reputation damage: Immeasurable impact on customer relationships and talent acquisition
* Legal risk: Potential regulatory action and discrimination lawsuits

**The Investment Required:**

* Comprehensive equity program: ₦1.8M implementation cost
* Projected ROI: 180% within 18 months through improved retention and engagement

**The Opportunity:** Palmora could transform from crisis management to industry leadership. The successful practices already demonstrated in Engineering and Services prove organizational change is achievable.

---

## **15. IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1–3)**

**Focus:** Address immediate compliance and fairness issues

* Mandatory performance evaluation rollout
* Manager training program launch
* Compensation audit completion

### **Phase 2: Standardization (Months 4–9)**

**Focus:** Scale successful practices across the organization

* Policy framework development
* Best practice scaling from successful departments
* Regional compensation review

### **Phase 3: Optimization (Months 10–18)**

**Focus:** Create sustainable, long-term solutions

* Cultural competency training
* Mentorship program launch
* External validation processes

---

## **16. LESSONS LEARNED AND REFLECTIONS**

**What This Project Taught Me**

**Data Tells Stories, But Context Gives Them Meaning:** The raw numbers showed disparities, but understanding the "why" behind them was crucial for developing effective solutions.
**Success Leaves Clues:** The fact that some departments had achieved equity showed that the problem wasn't insurmountable—it was about scaling successful practices.
**Change Requires Both Systems and Culture:** You can't fix compensation gaps with policy changes alone. You need to address the underlying cultural factors that create and perpetuate inequity.

**What I'm Proud Of**
This project didn't just identify problems—it provided a roadmap for solutions. More importantly, it gave Palmora's leadership the confidence to make difficult but necessary changes because they had data-driven insights to guide their decisions.
